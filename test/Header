## Highlights

Made a resume formatter
* Misused bash to concatenate files together
* Made a temp file the right way
* Mostly ignored error handling, except one statement
* But it only took me like 20 minutes so yay
* Unicodes and SVGs are in the header above (not all unicodes; you'll have to guess which)
* Now I'm going to inject some whitespace.
